# BSMS-CAPSTONE
Full stack implementation of the Blind Spot Management System (BSMS); an IoT-based parking safety project using Arduino, ultrasonic sensors, and a React dashboard connected through the Web Serial API. The system provides real time blind spot detection, parking space monitoring, and visual alerts for both drivers and lot controllers.
